\section{Fredholm-Shauder theory}
Fredholm-Shauder theory is based on compact operator definition.
\begin{defn}
  $A \colon A \xrightarrow{linear} X$ is called \textbf{compact}, if $\forall M 
  \text{ --- bounded } \in X \implies \cl{A(M)}$ --- compact in $Y$. It is easy to understand that any
  compact linear operator is continuous.
\end{defn}
