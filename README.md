# Functional-analysis
This repository will contain LaTex version of my notes on
NRU ITMO 2015-16 Functional analysis course as taught by Dodonov N.U.
For now the notes will be in English but I might add a Russian translation later on.
Live branch contains unrefactored live lecture notes, while master contains final refactored version.
