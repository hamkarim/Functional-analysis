\section{Kolmogorov theorem}
\begin{defn}
  $X$ --- linear set, $\tau$ --- topology on $X$, $\alpha x$, $x + y$ are
  continuous on $\tau$.

  \noindent $E(x)$ is neighbourhood of $x$.
  
  \noindent $\alpha x$ continuity means:
  \[
    \forall E(\alpha_0 x_0)\ \exists \delta > 0,\ \exists E(x_0) \colon
    |\alpha - \alpha_0| < \delta,\ x \in E(x_0) \implies
    \alpha x \in E(\alpha_0 x_0),
  \]
  or
  \[
    \alpha_0 x_0 = \lim_{\substack{\alpha \to \alpha _0\\ x \to x_0}} \alpha x.
  \]
  \noindent $x + y$ continuity means:
  \[
    \forall E(x_0 + y_0)\ \exists E(x_0), E(y_0) \colon
    x \in E(x_0), y \in E(y_0) \implies x + y \in E(x_0 + y_0),
  \]
  or 
  \[
    x_0 + y_0 = \lim_{\substack{x \to x_0\\ y \to y_0}}(x + y).
  \]
\end{defn}

It is clear that normed and countably-normed spaces are just a special case of
topological vector spaces.

\noindent
$x_0$ --- fix. \\
$f(x) = x + x_0,\ X \times X $ \\
$f^{-1}(y) = y - x_0$ \\
$f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous (by addition continuity) --- gomeomorphism. \\
$G$ --- open in $X$, $G \in \tau$, $x_0 + G = \Set{x_0 + x, x \in G}$ --- open. \\
This means any topology is invariant relative to shift. \\
If $\Sigma$ --- base of zero neighbourhoods (union of all zero neighbourhoods), any
other zero neighbourhood 

$x \to 0$ in $\tau$ $x + x \to 0 + 0 = 0$\\
$\forall V \in \sigma\ \exists U \in \sigma \colon U + U \subset V,\ 2 \cdot U
\subset U + U \subset V$ \\
$\lambda x \to 0,\ \lambda \to 0,\ x \to 0\ \forall V \sigma\ \exists \epsilon >
0,\ U \in \sigma\ |\lambda| \leq \epsilon \implies \lambda U \subset V$ \\
$\bigcup\limits_{|\lambda| \leq \epsilon} \lambda U$ --- radial, also zero
neighbourhood. That means if $X$ is a topological vector space then system of open
sets is shift-invariant and such base can be created that:
$\sigma$ 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\forall V \in \sigma\ \exists U \in \sigma: U + U \subset V$
\item All elements of $\sigma$ are radial, circled sets.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{defn}
  Topological space is called Hausdorff space, if any pair of points can be
  divided by their neighbourhoods, i.e. there exist disjoint neighbourhoods of such points.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}[Kolmogorov]
  Hausdorff topological vector space is normalizable if and only if zero has at least one 
  limited, convex neighbourhood (the set is limited if it is absorbed by any zero's neighbourhood).
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Minkowski functional is halfnorm if and only if it is produced by radial,
  circled set. If space is normalizable then unit ball is limited, convex zero's
  neighbourhood.
  By the former characterization of vector space topology, having limited, convex zero's
  neighbourhood we can assume we have radial, circled neighbourhood. Produce Minkowski
  functional using it (it will be halfnorm). We can assume the set is limited.
  $V$ --- limited, convex, circled. $\Set{\dfrac{1}{n}V, b \in \N}$
  $\forall$ limited.
  $W$ $|\lambda| \geq \lambda_0$, $V \subset \lambda W$
  $\exists n_0 \in \N > \lambda_0$
  $V \subset n_0 W$ $\dfrac{1}{n_0} V \subset W$ \\
  Now we only have to check that functional is norm.
  $p_V(x) = 0 \implies x = 0?$ \\
  $x \in \bigcap\limits_{n = 1}^\infty \left(\dfrac{1}{n} V\right) = \{0\}$
\end{proof}

\begin{ex}
  $\R^\infty = \Set{(x_1, \dotsc, x_n, \dotsc)}$ \\
  $\Set{\bar{x} \colon x_{i_1} \in (-\delta_1, \delta_1),\ x_{i_2} \in
    (-\delta_2, \delta_2), \dotsc, x_{i_p} \in (-\delta_p, \delta_p),\ \delta_j
    > 0}$ --- this system will produce zero's base and insure coordinatewise
  convergence. $P_n(\bar{x}) = |x_n|$ all of the halfnorms are essential, which
  means the space is not normalizable.
\end{ex}
